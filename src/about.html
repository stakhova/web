                        <p>Becoming a coach is the culmination of my life journey, which has spanned two careers, living and culturally integrating in several countries, and diverse life experiences along the way.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>My first career spans over 20 years of global experience in brand and communication strategy. I worked for some of the most prominent creative agencies in Europe and the USA, growing and reinventing brands for world-class companies and start-ups alike. I currently act as an expert consultant, advisor, and mentor, focusing on building brands, using brands as instruments of growth, and creating customer-centred cultures.</p>
                        <p>My second life is that of a dance artist and award-winning choreographer. My professional portfolio includes contemporary dance, Argentine tango, and movement direction. I directed my own full-length productions, created performances for stage, and worked as a guest choreographer for various dance and drama companies. My work has been selected for multiple international festivals and has won awards. My performance credits include the London 2012 Olympic Opening Ceremony and various high-profile events around Europe. I teach creative movement, partner work, and Argentine tango internationally. As a coach, I bring the two worlds of business and art together.</p>
                        <p>I hold an MBA from IESE Business School (Barcelona, Spain), an MA from Trinity Laban Conservatoire (London, UK), and am completing the Professional Certificate in Executive Coaching (PCEC) with Henley Business School in Berlin, where I currently reside.</p>
