                        <p>My approach to coaching is a reflection of my own identity, aiming to empower others through self-discovery and personal growth. It has been shaped by a lifetime of diverse experiences, experimentation, and dealing with adversity.</p>
                        <hr>
                        <p>These personal and professional experiences have taught me to recognize and appreciate the immensity of one's own resources—from willpower and innate skills to empathy and kindness. Helping individuals and teams tap into and amplify their resources is at the center of my coaching philosophy.</p>
                        <p>My clients say that I help them gain a fresh perspective on their situations, recognize the broader context and dynamics at play, and adopt a more systematic approach. Ultimately, this enables them to make better life and business decisions. I see these experiences as a form of partner dance governed by equality, mutual trust, and the joy of discovering new possibilities.</p>
