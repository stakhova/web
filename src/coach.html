                                    <p>Creativity is a fundamental skill behind innovation. It blends craft, science, art, and business savvy. Contrary to popular belief, creativity isn’t a divine gift bestowed on a lucky few, but an intrinsic human capacity that can be developed, refined, and applied through skills and techniques. The best way to discover and develop one’s own creativity is to practice it.</p>
                                    <p>New technologies keep challenging and stimulating us, humans, with questions about our role and ways to harness new opportunities. One thing is certain: AI will not replace or make human creativity extinct. It is here to stay and is needed more than ever.</p>

My training at the world-famous Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London has equipped me with proficiency in various movement styles and techniques, such as release, contact improvisation, and partner work. Additionally, I am a professional Argentine tango dancer with years of teaching experience.
                                        Through movement coaching, I guide individuals in exploring and harnessing their body's natural potential, fostering a deeper connection between mind and body, and becoming more present in every sense.</p>
