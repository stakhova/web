                        <p>Movement coaching is based on somatic approach and draws from my lifelong experience as a dancer. I trained as contemporary dancer in world-famous Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance (London, UK) and am adept at a variety of movement styles and techniques, including release, contact improvisation, and partner work.</p>
