                        <h2>Cue-Cards <br> and Self-Driving Cars</h2>
                        <p> I’ve just finished 3 days with a new client. Eve is in month 7 of her 9 months of maternity leave, having given birth to her second child – her first son - at the beginning of the year. The four of them, the 2 little ones and her husband live 45 minutes outside of Edinburgh, her hometown. Her husband is from the Basque country of Northern Spain.</p>
                        <p>Those are the basics, and what I learnt when she first reached out to me via LinkedIn 4 weeks ago. She heard of me via her company’s distant learning service last year while she was going for a promotion during pregnancy. My on-demand video teachings on overwhelm, clarity, presence and stress that I’d created for her company had been a big help to her. I’d also been recommended by her manager from a number of live sessions I’d done for senior managers over the past 5-6 years.</p>
                        <p>Eve explained in our first ‘discovery’ call that we’d set up that she needed to re-set the model of her life. I noticed she talked fast. Everything seemed important and urgent to her. The house (too small). The location (too cold). The job (too much to do). The husband (lovely, but too laid back). The kids (two is more than one plus one). The salary (too little). The life she was living (too far below her potential).</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>When she slowed down, Eve asked me if I could help, I knew I could. The fact that she started out by saying that what she thought she needed was a re-set of her model of life let me know she was on to something, but I didn’t know what that meant. So, I asked her. She came back with this:
                            “With all that’s going on, I should feel happy. But I don’t. I can’t even blame the kids. The baby sleeps, well, like a baby!” she said.</p>
                        <p>She went on to say that she thought there was something wrong with her that she felt unhappy. I carried on listening. She asked me about depression, having told me that she’d read my chapter in Chana Studley’s book that came out recently called ‘Beyond Diagnosis.’</p>
                        <p>“I don’t understand what you wrote, but I felt a lot of hope in your story and it was then that I messaged you,” she said.</p>
                        <p>We chatted and discussed some options for us to spend time in me coaching her, agreeing on a 3-day immersion at the start then one session every 2 weeks for the following 5 months to the end of the year – well into the time Eve would return to work. The logistics of taking care of the baby and her 3-year-old daughter were managed by her husband’s flexible working hours and her sister being able to stay for the week.
                            <br>Done, sorted.</p>
